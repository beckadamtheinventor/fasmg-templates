ABOUT:
"ez80.inc" has been around for quite some time for assembly programming with fasmg for the TI-84+CE platform.
There aren't a whole lot of templates lying around on the internet, so I decided to make a few.
Much thanks and credit to MateoConLechuga. Without him, these templates would have never seen the light of day.


TEMPLATES:
"template" has all the needed include files, and is pre-packaged with macros by me and "lcd.asm" by MateoConLechuga!
"clibs_template" has all the needed include files, and comes with a libloader subroutine and a set of common function references.
"easy_clibs_template" has all the needed include files, and much more! Check out "easy_clibs_template/doc.txt" for more details


NOTES:
There are a few WIP include files. Use at your own risk, they are not likely to work.
